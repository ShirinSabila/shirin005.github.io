  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am Shirin Akter, 
    a passionate CSE student who is highly interested in programming, 
    software development, and modern technology. 
    I completed my SSC (2019) and HSC (2021) from Ghatail Cantonment Public School and 
    College, 
    and I am currently pursuing my BSc in Computer Science & Engineering at University
    of Asia Pacific in Dhaka.
    As a learner, 
    I enjoy solving programming problems, exploring new technologies, and continuously improving my skills to become a professional software developer in the future.

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    My hobbies reflect my curiosity and creativity. I love travelling because it allows me to explore new environments and cultures. Photography is another passion of mine, as it helps me capture meaningful moments and develop an artistic perspective. I also enjoy gardening, which relaxes my mind and teaches patience and care. Alongside these,
     I often spend time learning coding concepts and practicing programming challenges.
